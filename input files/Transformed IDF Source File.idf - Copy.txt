E-MTAB-5412	1.1	Differential analysis of GM-CSF-induced inflammatory monocyte-derived cells (MCs) isolated from various organs	Differential analysis of GM-CSF-induced inflammatory monocyte-derived cells (MCs) isolated from various organs	"Elevated frequencies of GM-CSF-producing helper T (TH) cells are consistently found in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and GM-CSF expression is a non-redundant feature of pathogenic TH cells in preclinical models of MS. GM-CSF activates an inflammatory signature in monocytes, and their progeny are the most abundant cellular infiltrate in acute MS lesions. To model deregulated GM-CSF levels, we generated a transgenic mouse line allowing the induction of GM-CSF expression in mature, peripheral TH cells. This antigen-independent GM-CSF release induced severe neurological deficits with almost 100% penetrance, accompanied by the infiltration of inflammatory monocyte-derived myeloid cells into the brain stem and spinal cord. Other organs did not show obvious signs for clinical pathology, despite also being infiltrated by inflammatory myeloid cells. We aim to unravel differences between organs, their responses and also the potential of tissue destruction by infiltrating cells by sequencing inflammatory myeloid cells isolate from the individual organs."	population based design	EFO	EFO_0001430	organism part	organism part			Spath	Sabine		spath@immunology.uzh.ch			Winterthurerstrasse 190 8057 Zurich	Institute of Experimental Immunology University of Zurich	submitter	6/1/2017	P-MTAB-53566	treatment protocol	EFO	EFO_0003969	"4 weeks of tamoxifen chow pellets, Harlan Teklad CRD TAM400/CreER"			EFO	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/		RNA-seq of coding RNA	E-MTAB-5414	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERR1813629-ERR1813643	ERP021240	E-MTAB-5412.sdrf.txt
